	abstract = {Functional brain network organisation, measured by functional connectivity (FC), reflects key neurodevelopmental processes for healthy development. Early exposure to adversity, e.g. undernutrition, affects neurodevelopment, observable via disrupted FC, and leads to poorer outcomes from preschool age onward. We assessed longitudinally the impact of early growth trajectories on developmental FC in a rural Gambian population from age 5 to 24 months. To investigate how these early trajectories relate to later childhood outcomes, we assessed cognitive flexibility at 3-5 years. We observed that early physical growth before the fifth month of life drove optimal developmental trajectories of FC that in turn predicted cognitive flexibility at pre-school age. In contrast to previously studied developmental populations, this Gambian sample exhibited long-range interhemispheric FC that decreased with age. Our results highlight the measurable effects that poor growth in early infancy has on brain development and the subsequent impact on pre-school age cognitive development, underscoring the need for early life interventions throughout global settings of adversity},

	abstract = {Recent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrumentation encompasses several dozen of optodes to enable reconstructing a hemodynamic image of the entire cerebral cortex. Despite its potential clinical applicability, widespread use of fNIRS with human subjects is currently limited by unresolved issues, namely the collection from the entirety of optical channels of signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sufficient to carry out a reliable estimation of cortical hemodynamics, and the considerable amount of time that placing numerous optodes take with individuals for whom achieving good optical coupling to the scalp is difficult due to thick or dark hair. To address these issues, we developed a numerical method that: 1) at the channel level, computes an objective measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) related to its optical coupling to the scalp, akin to electrode conductivity used in electroencephalography (EEG), and 2) at the optode level, determines and displays the coupling status of all individual optodes in real time on a model of a human head. This approach aims to shorten the pre-acquisition preparation time by visually displaying which optodes require further adjustment for optimum scalp coupling, and to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all optical channels contributing to the functional hemodynamic mapping. The methodology described in this paper has been implemented in a software tool named PHOEBE (placing headgear optodes efficiently before experimentation) that is freely available for use by the fNIRS community.},

Twenty-three dyads of children watched a video alone or together in Experiment 1, engaged in joint or self-paced book reading in Experiment 2, and pretended to play a Jenga game or played for real in Experiment 3. We found that all three formats of social interactions increased IBC in the frontotemporoparietal networks, which have been reported to support social interaction. Further, our results revealed the shared and unique interbrain connections that were predictive of the lower and higher parent-reported autism-spectrum quotient scores, which indicated child autistic traits.

	abstract = {Introduction Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising tool for studying brain activity, offering advantages such as portability and affordability. However, challenges in data collection persist due to factors like participant physiology, environmental light, and gross-motor movements, with limited literature on their impact on fNIRS signal quality. This study addresses four potentially influential factors–hair color, hair cleanliness, environmental light, and gross-motor movements–on fNIRS signal quality. Our aim is to raise awareness and offer insights for future fNIRS research. Methods Six participants (4 Females, 2 Males) took part in four different experiments investigating the effects of hair color, hair cleanliness, environmental light, and gross-motor movements on fNIRS signal quality. Participants in Experiment 1, categorized by hair color, completed a finger-tapping task in a between-subjects block design. Signal quality was compared between each hair color. Participants in Experiments 2 and 3 completed a finger-tapping task in a within-subjects block design, with signal quality being compared across hair cleanliness (i.e., five consecutive days without washing the hair) and environmental light (i.e., sunlight, artificial light, no light, etc.), respectively. Experiment 4 assessed three gross-motor movements (i.e., walking, turning and nodding the head) in a within-subjects block design. Motor movements were then compared to resting blocks. Signal quality was evaluated using Scalp Coupling Index (SCI) measurements. Results Lighter hair produced better signals than dark hair, while the impact of environmental light remains uncertain. Hair cleanliness showed no significant effects, but gross motor movements notably reduced signal quality. Conclusion Our results suggest that hair color, environmental light, and gross-motor movements affect fNIRS signal quality while hair cleanliness does not. Nevertheless, future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to fully understand these effects. To advance future research, comprehensive documentation of participant demographics and lab conditions, along with signal quality analyses, is essential.},

With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.},

Due to the on-head placement of optodes, artifacts arising from head motion are relatively less severe than for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, it is still necessary to remove motion artifacts. We present a novel motion correction procedure based on robust regression, which effectively removes baseline shift and spike artifacts without the need for any user-supplied parameters. Our simulations show that this method yields better activation detection performance than 5 other current motion correction methods. In our empirical validation on a working memory task in a sample of children 7–15 years, our method produced stronger and more extensive activation than any of the other methods tested. The new motion correction method enhances the viability of fNIRS as a functional neuroimaging modality for use in populations not amenable to fMRI.},

NIRS can therefore be used for more naturalistic experiments, including face to face communication, or natural body movements, and is well suited for real-time applications that may require lengthy training. However, improving signal quality and reducing noise, especially noise induced by head motion, is challenging, particularly for real time applications. Here we study the properties of head motion induced noise, and find that motion noise causes the measured oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signals, which are typically strongly negatively correlated, to become more positively correlated. Next, we develop a method to reduce noise based on the principle that the concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin should be negatively correlated. We show that despite its simplicity, this method is effective in reducing noise and improving signal quality, for both online and offline noise reduction.},

Additionally, there is often a lack of a complete description of the methods applied, necessary for study replication or for results comparison. The aims of this paper were (i) to review and investigate which information is generally included in published fNIRS papers, and (ii) to define a signal pre-processing procedure to set a common ground for standardization guidelines. To this goal, we have reviewed 110 fNIRS articles published in 2016 in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and performed a simulation analysis with synthetic fNIRS data to optimize the signal filtering step before applying the GLM method for statistical inference. Our results highlight the fact that many papers lack important information, and there is a large variability in the filtering methods used. Our simulations demonstrated that the optimal approach to remove noise and recover the hemodynamic response from fNIRS data in a GLM framework is to use a 1000th order band-pass Finite Impulse Response filter. Based on these results, we give preliminary recommendations as to the first step toward improving the analysis of fNIRS data and dissemination of the results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

Aim: We aim to assess the impact of different analysis procedures on the morphology, detection, and lateralization of auditory responses in fNIRS. Specifically, we determine whether averaging or generalized linear model (GLM)-based analysis generates different experimental conclusions when applied to a block-protocol design. The impact of parameter selection of GLMs on detecting auditory-evoked responses was also quantified. Approach: 17 listeners were exposed to three commonly employed auditory stimuli: noise, speech, and silence. A block design, comprising sounds of 5 s duration and 10 to 20 s silent intervals, was employed. Results: Both analysis procedures generated similar response morphologies and amplitude estimates, and both indicated that responses to speech were significantly greater than to noise or silence. Neither approach indicated a significant effect of brain hemisphere on responses to speech. Methods to correct for systemic hemodynamic responses using short channels improved detection at the individual level. Conclusions: Consistent with theoretical considerations, simulations, and other experimental domains, GLM and averaging analyses generate the same group-level experimental conclusions. We release this dataset publicly for use in future development and optimization of algorithms.},

	abstract = {The modified Beer–Lambert law (MBLL) is the basis of continuous-wave near-infrared tissue spectroscopy (cwNIRS). The differential form of MBLL (dMBLL) states that the change in light attenuation is proportional to the changes in the concentrations of tissue chromophores, mainly oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. If attenuation changes are measured at two or more wavelengths, concentration changes can be calculated. The dMBLL is based on two assumptions: (1) the absorption of the tissue changes homogeneously, and (2) the scattering loss is constant. It is known that absorption changes are usually inhomogeneous, and therefore dMBLL underestimates the changes in concentrations (partial volume effect) and every calculated value is influenced by the change in the concentration of other chromophores (cross-talk between chromophores). However, the error introduced by the second assumption (cross-talk of scattering changes) has not been assessed previously. An analytically treatable special case (semi-infinite, homogeneous medium, with optical properties of the cerebral cortex) is utilized here to estimate its order of magnitude. We show that the per cent change of the transport scattering coefficient and that of the absorption coefficient have an approximately equal effect on the changes of attenuation, and a 1\% increase in scattering increases the estimated concentration changes by about 0.5 µM.},

	abstract = {Significance
Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is unique among neuroimaging techniques in its ability to estimate changes in both oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). However, fNIRS research has applied various data reporting practices based on these chromophores as measures of neural activation.

Aim
To quantify the variability of fNIRS chromophore data reporting practices and to explore recent data reporting trends in the literature.

Approach
We reviewed 660 fNIRS papers from 2015, 2018, and 2021 to extract information on fNIRS chromophore data reporting practices.

Results
Our review revealed five general practices for reporting fNIRS chromophores: (1) HbO only, (2) HbR only, (3) HbO and HbR, (4) correlation-based signal improvement, and (5) either the total (HbT) or difference (HbDiff) in concentration between chromophores. The field was primarily divided between reporting HbO only and reporting HbO and HbR. However, reporting one chromophore (HbO) was consistently observed as the most popular data reporting practice for each year reviewed.

Conclusions
Our results highlight the high heterogeneity of chromophore data reporting in fNIRS research. We discuss its potential implications for study comparison efforts and interpretation of results. Most importantly, our review demonstrates the need for a standard chromophore reporting practice to improve scientific transparency and, ultimately, to better understand how neural events relate to cognitive phenomena.},
