%The RADIATE contains perceptually validated images of racially and ethnically diverse participants, aged 18-30 years old, each expressing 16 different emotions. 
%The UIBVFED dataset contains a set of 20 virtual characters that are also ethnically diverse, aged 20-80 years old expressing 32 emotions. 
%The UIBVFED faces were created using blendshapes, a tool that represents and manipulates clusters of facial landmarks similar to that of facial action units (Ekman and Friesen, 1978).

%The signal level is the voltage reading at a detector optode, which reflects how well light passes through the tissue from a source optode to a detector optode.
